# Myers and Briggs Country Personalities
Analyzed each of the top 10 countries with their most and least common MBTI personality types to search for any correlation with their average Gross National Income per capita

# About
Personality typing attempts to find the broadest, most important ways in which people are different, and make sense of these differences by sorting people into meaningful groups. 
The personality types described here were created by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs, in the 1960's, and their theories were based off the work of psychologist Carl Jung. Myers and Briggs proposed that there were four key dimensions that could be used to categorize people:
Introversion vs. Extraversion
Sensing vs. Intuition
Thinking vs. Feeling	
Judging vs. Perceiving

# What do each of the letters mean?
I/E: Introversion or Extraversion - describes how a person manages their energy.

S/N: Sensing or Intuition- dimension describes how an individual processes information.

T/F: Thinking or Feeling- describes how people make decisions.

J/P: Judging or Perceiving- describes how people approach structure in their lives.

# Country v. MBTI Personality % 
This dataset gives the percentage of the population belonging to each MBTI type for each country. 


# Country v. GNI per Capita
Gross National Income (GNI) per capita is the a country’s final income per year (1990-2018) divided by its population. 

Gross National Income (GNI) is a measurement of the social, economic, and environmental well-being of a country and its citizens.

There is a negative correlation as shown by the regression line. 

Correlation Coefficient: (-30857.776)

A Mediator (INFP) is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do.


We found that INFP-T is the most popular personality trait in all of the 10 best countries, and the least most popular personality is ESTP-T. 
When looking at other countries in the dataset, we found that each of the other countries varied greatly in their most popular personality type percentage. 
For example, in Afghanistan, the most popular personality trait is ESTJ-A. However, in each of the 10 best countries, the most popular personality trait remained constant.  

According to the regression line, there is a negative correlation between countries with higher incomes and countries with a higher population percentage of INFP-T. So, of the 10 best countries, those with higher incomes actually have a lower percentage of INFP-T population percentages. 
This is very interesting, because INFP-T is a rare personality trait according to 16personalities.com.
INFP personalities, or Mediators, share a sincere curiosity about the depths of human nature. Introspective to the core, they’re exquisitely attuned to their own thoughts and feelings, but they yearn to understand the people around them as well. Mediators are compassionate and nonjudgmental, always willing to hear another person’s story. When someone opens up to them or turns to them for comfort, they feel honored to listen and be of help. 

Knowing that this is the most common personality trait in the top 10 countries, we can better understand what type of trait is best needed for a company to be strong and for people to work together in harmony. Seeing correlation shows that there are clear patterns between GNI per Capita and personality types. Understanding that Mediators are negatively correlated with average GNI per Capita introduces many new questions about how we can understand human nature in numbers and personality data. 


The least common personality trait was ESTP. An Entrepreneur (ESTP) is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of them. They love uncovering life’s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits.
