# Myers_and_Briggs_Country_Personalities

# About
Personality typing attempts to find the broadest, most important ways in which people are different, and make sense of these differences by sorting people into meaningful groups. 
The personality types described here were created by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs, in the 1960's, and their theories were based off the work of psychologist Carl Jung. Myers and Briggs proposed that there were four key dimensions that could be used to categorize people:
Introversion vs. Extraversion
Sensing vs. Intuition
Thinking vs. Feeling	
Judging vs. Perceiving

# What do each of the letters mean?
I/E: Introversion or Extraversion - describes how a person manages their energy.

S/N: Sensing or Intuition- dimension describes how an individual processes information.

T/F: Thinking or Feeling- describes how people make decisions.

J/P: Judging or Perceiving- describes how people approach structure in their lives.
